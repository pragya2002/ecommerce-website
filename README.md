This is a fully implemented simple e-commerce website which can be used as a facilitator between a company and the customers. 

I have developed the user app as well as the admin app in this mini-project with the help of flask and SQLAlchemy. Since this is my first backend development project and as I am still a beginner, the features are pretty basic. 

## PUBLIC APP:
- Can be used to create new signups and login into existing accounts in the company database. 
- Customer can browse through the products displayed, which are regularly updated by the admin subject to availability and add them to their respective carts. 
- Cart displays the price and quantity of each item and the grand total. Users can place their orders directly from the button provided at the bottom. 
- Users can also provide their feedback which shall be intimated to the admin via email as well as stored in the database. 

## ADMIN APP:
- Admin can easily authenticate themselves via their username and password. 
- Details of all the products available shall be provided which can be modified as well as deleted permanently. 
- Details of all the users registered to the database shall be available as well as modifiable. 
- Order details of each and every user (including date and time of order and the products) shall be displayed which once marked delivered shall be removed. 

As of now, I have not added any payment method as I am still very new to backend development.
